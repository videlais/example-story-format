# Example
This is an example story format for Twine 2.

See the blog series [Creating your own Twine 2 Story Format](https://videlais.com/2020/02/28/creating-your-own-twine-2-story-format-part-1-understanding-twine-2-html-structures/) for more details.

## Building

`node index.js` will build a "format.js" file in the `dist` folder. This can then be loaded in Twine 2 or used with Twee tools.
